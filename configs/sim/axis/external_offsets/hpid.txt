hpid.ini - height (Z axis) PID control using external offsets (torch height control)

Usage:
  1) Estop OFF  (F1)
  2) Machine ON (F2)
  3) HOME All   (Ctrl-Home)
  4) Run        (R)

A torch height measurement is simulated with a single-pole low-pass filter.

A number of hal pins are made available with simple sim_pin guis for tuning and testing.

The simulated torch height controller frequency response is set by the hal pin:
  torch-height.gain
The nominal gain setting of 0.0609 emulates a low pass filter with a 10Hz cutoff frequency.
(See the man page for the low pass component)

The PID gains are set by the hal pins:
   zo.pgain
   zo.igain
   zo.dgain

The PERTURB On/Off buttons control a signal generator that alters the requested torch-volts.
The introduced perturbations are useful for tuning the PID settings and may be used when the program is running or paused.

Hal pins for the perturbing signal generator and for ini velocity and accceleration items are:
   ini.z.max_velocity
   ini.z.max_acceleration
   sig.frequency
   sig.amplitude
